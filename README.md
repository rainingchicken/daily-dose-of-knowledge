I have been getting a lot of shorts showing how to solve problems from the SAT recently so I wanted to make an app to get random problems and solve them.

## API

https://github.com/Anas099X/OpenSAT?tab=readme-ov-file

[Anas099X](https://github.com/Anas099X) <- API creator

## Tech

- NEXT.JS
- TypeScript
- DaisyUI
- useForm
- react-markdown
- localStorage

## Todo

- add acccessbility settings to change themes, fontsize, etc
- maybe the ability to revisit completed questions
- a button to report question or contest for points in case "correct answer" is wrong
